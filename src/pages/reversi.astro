            <p>Two players, dark and light, play against each other.</p>
            <p>
                Dark and light take turns placing one stone each, aiming to have
                more stones at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Place one of your stones in a square on the board. Turn over the
                opponent's stones that are sandwiched vertically, horizontally,
                or diagonally between your stones already on the board and the
                stones you have just placed, and make them your stones.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot place a stone in a place where it cannot be
                sandwiched.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is no place where it can be placed, it is the
                opponent's turn without placing a stone. (Pass)
            </p>
            <p>
                If neither player can place a stone, the game ends. The number
                of stones on the board is counted, and the player with the most
                stones wins.
