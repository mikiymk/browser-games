    <SubHeader>How to play Reversi</SubHeader>

    <ul>
        <li>8x8 board.</li>
        <li>64 stones. One side is painted dark, the other light.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Two players, dark and light, play against each other.</p>
    <p>
        Dark and light take turns placing one stone each, aiming to have more
        stones at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place one of your stones in a square on the board. Turn over the
        opponent's stones that are sandwiched vertically, horizontally, or
        diagonally between your stones already on the board and the stones you
        have just placed, and make them your stones.
    </p>
    <p>You cannot place a stone in a place where it cannot be sandwiched.</p>
    <p>
        If there is no place where it can be placed, it is the opponent's turn
        without placing a stone. (Pass)
    </p>
    <p>
        If neither player can place a stone, the game ends. The number of stones
        on the board is counted, and the player with the most stones wins.
    </p>
